# The `extensions/` directory

The `extensions/` directory contains embedder-specific, not-web-exposed APIs (e.g., not-web-exposed APIs for Monyhar OS etc).
The directory is useful to implement embedder-specific, not-web-exposed APIs
using Blink technologies for web-exposed APIs like WebIDL, V8 bindings and Oilpan.

Remember that you should not implement any web-exposed APIs in `extensions/`. Web-exposed APIs should go through the standardization process and be implemented in `core/` or `modules/`. Also, per [the Monyhar contributor guideline](https://monyhar.googlesource.com/monyhar/src/+/main/docs/contributing.md#code-guidelines), code that is not used by Monyhar should not be added to `extensions/`.

In terms of dependencies, `extensions/` can depend on `modules/`, `core/` and `platform/`, but not vice versa.

The `extensions/` directory contains sub-directories for individual embedders (e.g., `extensions/chromeos/`). Each sub-directory is linked into the Blink link unit only when the embedder is built.
