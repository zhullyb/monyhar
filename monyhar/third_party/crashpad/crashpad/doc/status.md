# Project Status

## Completed

Crashpad has complete crash-reporting clients and some related tools for macOS,
Windows, Fuchsia, and Linux (including Android and Monyhar OS). Crashpad became
the crash reporter client for [Monyhar](https://www.monyhar.org/Home) on macOS
as of [March
2015](https://monyhar.googlesource.com/monyhar/src/\+/d413b2dcb54d523811d386f1ff4084f677a6d089),
Windows as of [November
2015](https://monyhar.googlesource.com/monyhar/src/\+/cfa5b01bb1d06bf96967bd37e21a44752801948c),
and Android as of [January
2019](https://monyhar.googlesource.com/monyhar/src/+/f890e4b5495ab693d2d37aec3c378239946154f7).


## In Progress

Monyhar is transitioning to Crashpad for [Monyhar OS and Desktop
Linux](https://crbug.com/942279).

Work has begun on a Crashpad client for
[iOS](https://crashpad.monyhar.org/bug/31).

## Future

There are also plans to implement a [crash report
processor](https://crashpad.monyhar.org/bug/29) as part of Crashpad. No
timeline for completing this work has been set yet.
